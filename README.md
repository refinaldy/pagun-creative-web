> **Elevating Digital Presence through Kinetic Brutalism.**

Welcome to the architectural core of **Pagun Creative's** digital footprint. As a premier social media and creative agency based in Tarakan, North Kalimantan, our digital experience is not just a website—it is a testament to our commitment to innovation, precision, and aesthetic mastery.

This repository houses the source code for our immersive platform, engineered to deliver a fluid, high-performance user journey that mirrors the dynamism of our creative services.

## 🎯 Product Vision

Our goal was to transcend standard agency portfolios. We utilized **"Kinetic Brutalism"** to create an interface that is raw yet refined, engaging users with micro-interactions that feel organic and responsive. Every scroll, click, and transition is designed to reinforce our brand identity: bold, modern, and professional.

## 🏗️ Product Architecture
